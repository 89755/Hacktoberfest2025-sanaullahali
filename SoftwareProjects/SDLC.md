## ðŸ“Œ Phases of SDLC

1. **Requirement Analysis**
   - Gather and analyze requirements from stakeholders.
   - Create functional and non-functional specifications.
   
2. **System Design**
   - Plan system architecture and database design.
   - Create UML diagrams, flowcharts, and wireframes.
   
3. **Implementation / Coding**
   - Convert design into actual code using programming languages.
   - Follow coding standards and best practices.
   
4. **Testing**
   - Test the software for bugs, errors, and performance issues.
   - Use unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing.
   
5. **Deployment**
   - Deploy the software to production environments.
   - Ensure smooth installation and setup for users.
   
6. **Maintenance**
   - Fix bugs, provide updates, and improve performance over time.
   - Incorporate user feedback and enhancements.

## ðŸ’¡ Best Practices
- Use version control (e.g., Git) for tracking changes.
- Follow modular programming principles.
- Document code and design decisions clearly.
- Regularly review and refactor code to improve quality.
